The JavaMail API provides a platform-independent and
protocol-independent framework to build mail and messaging
applications.
The JavaMail API is available as an optional package for use with the
[Java SE platform](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index.html)
and is also included in the
[Java EE platform](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/index.html).

From time to time snapshot releases of the next version of JavaMail
under development are published to the
[java.net Maven repository](http://maven.java.net).
These snapshot releases have received only minimal testing, but may
provide previews of bug fixes or new features under development.

For example, you can download the javax.mail.jar file from the JavaMail
1.6.0-SNAPSHOT release
[here](https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/snapshots/com/sun/mail/javax.mail/1.6.0-SNAPSHOT/).
Be sure to scroll to the bottom and choose the jar file with the most
recent time stamp.

A [Release Candidate version of JavaMail 1.6.0](https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/com/sun/mail/javax.mail/1.6.0-rc1/javax.mail-1.6.0-rc1.jar)
is now available. This is a non-final development release of JavaMail
1.6.0 suitable for testing. Your feedback on this release is
encouraged. The final release of JavaMail 1.6.0 is expected this
summer.
