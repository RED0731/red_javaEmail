JavaMail License
================

JavaMail uses several licenses:

-   Most of the JavaMail source code is licensed under the
    [Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) v1.1 and
    GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 with Classpath Exception](
    https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/CDDL+GPL-1.1);
    see the license information at the top of each source file.
-   The source code for the demo programs is licensed under the BSD
    license; again, the license is in each source file.
-   The binary jar files published to the Maven repository are licensed
    under the same CDDL and GPLv2+CE licenses as the corresponding source
    code; see the file `META-INF/LICENSE.txt` in each jar file.
-   The JavaMail API specification is licensed under the standard JCP
    Specification License.

You'll find the text of the CDDL and GPLv2+CE licenses in the workspace
in the files `LICENSE.txt` and `mail/src/main/resources/META-INF/LICENSE.txt`.
The specification license is in the workspace at
`mail/src/main/java/doc-files/speclicense.html`.
Don't let the presence of these license files in the workspace confuse
you into thinking that they apply to all files in the workspace.

You should always read the license file included with every download,
and read the license text included in every source file.
