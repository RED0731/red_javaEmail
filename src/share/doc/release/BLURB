JavaMail 1.1.2 Release
----------------------
The JavaMail API provides a set of abstract classes that model a mail
system. The API provides a platform independent and protocol
independent framework to build Java based mail and messaging
applications.

The JavaMail API is implemented as a Java standard extension. 
Sun provides a royalty-free reference implementation, in binary form,
that developers will be able to use and ship. 

This release contains version 1.1.2 of the JavaMail
implementation. It includes implementations of the core JavaMail 
packages - javax.mail and javax.mail.internet. Also included are
implementations of the IMAP and SMTP service providers.
Please see the CHANGES.txt file for changes made since the last release.
