<TITLE>javax.mail.search package</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="white">

<P>
Message search terms for the JavaMail API.
This package defines classes that can be used to construct a search
expression to search a folder for messages matching the expression;
see the {@link javax.mail.Folder#search search} method on
{@link javax.mail.Folder javax.mail.Folder}.
See {@link javax.mail.search.SearchTerm SearchTerm}.
</P>
<P>
Note that the exact search capabilities depend on the protocol,
provider, and server in use.  For the POP3 protocol, all searching is
done on the client side using the JavaMail classes.  For IMAP, all
searching is done on the server side and is limited by the search
capabilities of the IMAP protocol and the IMAP server being used.
For example, IMAP date based searches have only day granularity.
</P>
<P>
In general, all of the string patterns supported by search terms are
just simple strings; no regular expressions are supported.
</P>
