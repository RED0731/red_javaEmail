# Test data used by InternetAddressFoldTest.java to test folding of
# addresses using the InternetAddress.toString(Address[], int) method.
#
# Data format is:
#
# FOLD N
# address1$
# ...
# addressN$
# EXPECT
# address1, ..., addressN$
#
# That is, the FOLD line says how many addresses follow,
# each address is terminated by a dollar sign, allowing embedded CR and LF.
# EXPECT is followed by one string terminated by a dollar sign.
#

#
# First, test some simple non-folding and folding cases.
